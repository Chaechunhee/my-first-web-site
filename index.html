  <p>It is an information retrieval system
     that allows information on the Internet to be searched
     in hypertext and multimedia environments.</P>
     <P style="margin-top:20px;">
     It is a system that effectively retrieves various
     information on the Internet expressed in hypertext
     format and is the most widely used in the world. [One]
     Hypertext is displayed in the form of reading pieces
     of information such as "documents" or web pages from
     a web server through a program called a web browser
     and outputting them on a computer monitor .</p>
     <p>The user can then follow the hyperlinks on each page
     to another document, or send a set of information
     to a server serving that page. The act of following
     hyperlinks is often called web surfing
     (web surfing, cultural language : network tour [2] )
     or web browsing . And a set of web pages containing
     related contents is called a web site .</p>
     The English word worldwide ( worldwide ) is
     usually used as a single word without spaces or
     hyphens, but the World Wide Web and its abbreviation
     <strong><u>WWW</u></strong> are used as official English words.
     The World Wide Web can be summarized in the following
     three functions. How to specify the location of
     the first unified web resource eg URL .
     A protocol for accessing resource names on the second web,
     eg HTTP , and a third language for easy navigation
     between resources, eg HTML .
